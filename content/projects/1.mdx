// I design to make things better, and when a code tweak is needed, I roll up my sleeves and dive in.
```

## Design Process

### 1.) Research and Analysis
- Through interviews and surveys, I found out that our website's link jungle had users feeling like they were lost in an online maze! 🌐🤔

### 2.) Information Architecture Refinement
- I'm jazzing up navigation to make it as easy as pie (or as cake, if you prefer)! Our color palette's gone from a rainbow to black, blue, and white—less Skittles, more classics! And say hello to our font trio: Inter in regular, medium, and bold—because why settle for one font when you can have a font party? 🎉🎨🔠

### 3.) Wireframing & Prototyping
- I started with doodles on paper (aka wireframes) like a game of design Pictionary! Then, I upgraded to a "not-so-fancy" prototype to tweak and tinker—kinda like a design dress rehearsal. Finally, I went all out with a high-fidelity mockup, the diva of designs, for that polished, red-carpet look! 🎨✏️👗

## Usability Testing
- Played detective with students, teachers, and parent interviews 🕵️‍♂️
- Got the inside scoop from every college corner, like a design potluck 🍲
- Cooked up a design that's a crowd-pleaser for all our VIPs 🎉
- Happy stakeholders, happy life—nailed it! 👍
